<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hello mortals!<br />
This time I come with another creation, Chaos Pig Farm itself!<br />
Its based on regular pig farm model of course, but I remapped it to fill Outland scheme because it is designed for Fel Orcs in Outland/Black Citadel. Instead of regular rock, it is made from volcanic dark rocks. It also comes with some spikes around as they are common in Outland. it also come with pink demonic flower haha!<br />
And instead of standard pig, there is red demonic pig!<br />
