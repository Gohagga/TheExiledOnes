<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A simple, but intact gear. Is meant as a doodad but has a &quot;death&quot; animation and an alternate stand where it spins.<br />
<br />
Both a horizontal and a vertical type is included.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update 1:<br />
- Both type of gear can now turn both ways. Use &quot;Stand Victory&quot; and &quot;Stand Defend&quot;</p>
