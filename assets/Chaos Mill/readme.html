<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hello mortals! As I promised, quickly here comes Chaos mill, as reward for you being kind, and because you like my work and need more fel orc/demonic buildings.<br />
Chaos Mill is alternate version of War Mill. Instead of regular rock, it uses dark volcanic rock from Outland/Black Citadel. Also it has removed some of elements from original version, but added more demonic elements such as hot sharp spikes, two spiked obelisks and red grate.<br />
I hope you like it.<br />
